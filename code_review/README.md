# Code Review Framework for bartMachine C++ Port

## Overview
This directory contains the framework for conducting a systematic code review of the C++ port of bartMachine against the original Java implementation. The goal is to ensure that the C++ implementation is functionally equivalent to the Java implementation, producing identical results given the same inputs and random seeds.

## Contents
- [Discrepancy Template](discrepancy_template.md): Template for documenting individual code discrepancies
- [Issue Tracker](issue_tracker.md): Central document for tracking all identified issues
- [Comparison Methodology](comparison_methodology.md): Guidelines for systematically comparing Java and C++ code
- [Review Process](review_process.md): Detailed steps for conducting the code review
- [Framework Summary](framework_summary.md): Overview of the code review framework and its components
- [Task 7.0 Completion Report](task_7_0_completion_report.md): Summary of the work done for Task 7.0

## How to Use This Framework

### 1. Identifying Discrepancies
1. Follow the [Comparison Methodology](comparison_methodology.md) to systematically compare the Java and C++ code.
2. When you identify a discrepancy, create a new discrepancy report using the [Discrepancy Template](discrepancy_template.md).
3. Save the discrepancy report in the `discrepancies` directory with a unique identifier (e.g., `DISC-001.md`).
4. Add the discrepancy to the [Issue Tracker](issue_tracker.md).

### 2. Analyzing Discrepancies
1. Analyze each identified discrepancy to determine its impact and root cause.
2. Update the discrepancy report with your analysis.
3. Update the status in the [Issue Tracker](issue_tracker.md) to "Analyzed".
4. Prioritize the discrepancy based on its impact.

### 3. Fixing Discrepancies
1. Implement fixes for discrepancies, starting with the highest priority ones.
2. Update the discrepancy report with the implemented fix.
3. Update the status in the [Issue Tracker](issue_tracker.md) to "Fixed".

### 4. Verifying Fixes
1. Verify that the fix resolves the discrepancy.
2. Update the discrepancy report with the verification results.
3. Update the status in the [Issue Tracker](issue_tracker.md) to "Verified".

```

## Workflow
1. **Setup**: Create the directory structure and templates (already done).
2. **Review**: Conduct the code review following the comparison methodology.
3. **Document**: Document discrepancies using the template and update the issue tracker.
4. **Fix**: Implement fixes for the identified discrepancies.
5. **Verify**: Verify that the fixes resolve the discrepancies.
6. **Report**: Create a final report summarizing the findings and fixes.

## Best Practices
- Be thorough and systematic in your review.
- Document discrepancies as soon as you identify them.
- Prioritize discrepancies based on their impact.
- Verify fixes to ensure they resolve the discrepancies.
- Keep the issue tracker up to date.
- Communicate with the team about your findings and progress.
