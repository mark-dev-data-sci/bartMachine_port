# Task 7.1: R-to-C++ Bridge Implementation Plan

## Overview
This task involves creating R bindings for our C++ implementation of bartMachine, allowing R users to call our C++ code directly from R. This will replace the existing R-to-Java bridge in the original bartMachine package.

## Analysis of Current R-to-Java Bridge

Before implementing the R-to-C++ bridge, we need to understand how the current R-to-Java bridge works:

1. The R package uses `rJava` to interface with Java
2. R objects are converted to Java objects and vice versa
3. R functions call Java methods through JNI (Java Native Interface)
4. Data is passed between R and Java in specific formats

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Set Up Rcpp Environment

- Add Rcpp as a dependency in the R package
- Configure build system to compile C++ code with R
- Set up proper include paths and linking

### 2. Create C++ Interface Functions

- Implement C++ functions that will be exposed to R
- These functions should wrap our existing C++ implementation
- Handle data conversion between R and C++ formats
- Implement error handling and memory management

### 3. Create Rcpp Modules

- Use Rcpp modules to expose C++ classes to R
- Map C++ methods to R functions
- Ensure proper data type conversion

### 4. Modify R Package

- Update R package to use Rcpp instead of rJava
- Replace Java calls with C++ calls
- Maintain the same R API for backward compatibility

### 5. Testing and Validation

- Test basic connectivity between R and C++
- Verify data conversion works correctly
- Test all functionality to ensure it works as expected
- Compare results with the original Java implementation

## Key Considerations

### Data Type Conversion

| R Type | C++ Type |
|--------|----------|
| numeric | double |
| integer | int |
| logical | bool |
| character | std::string |
| vector | std::vector<T> |
| matrix | Rcpp::NumericMatrix |
| data.frame | Rcpp::DataFrame |

### Memory Management

- Use Rcpp's automatic memory management where possible
- Ensure proper cleanup of C++ resources
- Avoid memory leaks when passing data between R and C++

### Error Handling

- Implement proper error handling in C++ code
- Convert C++ exceptions to R errors
- Provide meaningful error messages to R users

## Implementation Steps

1. Analyze the existing R-to-Java bridge in detail
2. Set up Rcpp in the R package
3. Implement basic C++ interface functions
4. Test basic connectivity
5. Implement more complex functionality
6. Test and validate the complete implementation
7. Document the R-to-C++ bridge

## Validation Criteria

- R can successfully call C++ functions
- Data can be passed correctly between R and C++
- The R interface works with our C++ implementation as it did with the Java implementation
- All tests pass with the C++ backend
