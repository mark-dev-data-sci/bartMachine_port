# Task 5.4 Progress Summary: Metropolis-Hastings - Prune Operation

## Completed Implementation
We have successfully implemented the Metropolis-Hastings prune operation for the bartMachine port from Java to C++. The implementation includes the following methods:

1. `pickPruneNodeOrChangeNode()` - Selects a node suitable for pruning or changing. This method finds nodes that are "singly internal" (i.e., nodes that have two children, both of which are terminal nodes).

2. `calcLnTransRatioPrune()` - Calculates the log transition ratio for a prune step using the formula:
   ```
   log(w_2) - log(b - 1) - log(p_adj) - log(n_adj)
   ```
   where:
   - w_2 is the number of prunable nodes available in the original tree
   - b is the number of leaves in the original tree
   - p_adj is the adjusted probability of the node
   - n_adj is the number of possible split values for the node

3. `doMHPruneAndCalcLnR()` - Performs the prune step on a tree and returns the log Metropolis-Hastings ratio. This method:
   - Selects a node to prune
   - Calculates the log transition ratio
   - Calculates the log likelihood ratio (as the negative of the grow ratio)
   - Calculates the log tree structure ratio (as the negative of the grow ratio)
   - Prunes the tree at the selected node
   - Returns the sum of the three ratios

## Testing
All tests are now passing, confirming that the implementation correctly matches the behavior of the original Java code. The tests include:

1. Testing the `pickPruneNodeOrChangeNode()` method to ensure it correctly selects a node suitable for pruning.
2. Testing the `calcLnTransRatioPrune()` method to ensure it correctly calculates the log transition ratio for a prune step.
3. Testing the `doMHPruneAndCalcLnR()` method to ensure it correctly performs the prune step and calculates the log Metropolis-Hastings ratio.

## Next Steps
The next task (Task 5.5) will focus on implementing the Metropolis-Hastings change operation, which includes:

1. `doMHChangeAndCalcLnR()` - Performs the change step on a tree and returns the log Metropolis-Hastings ratio.
2. `calcLnLikRatioChange()` - Calculates the log likelihood ratio for a change step.
3. Related change calculation methods.

## Overall Progress
With the completion of Task 5.4, we have now implemented approximately 60-70% of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for the BART model. The remaining tasks include implementing the change operation (Task 5.5) and integrating the full Metropolis-Hastings workflow (Task 5.6).
