"""
Java bridge utilities for bartMachine.

This module provides functions for interacting with the Java backend of BART models.

R File Correspondence:
    This Python module corresponds to 'src/r/bartmachine_cpp_port/zzz.R' 
    in the original R package.

Role in Port:
    This module handles the low-level interaction with the Java backend of BART models.
    It provides functions for converting data between Python and Java, calling Java methods,
    and managing the Java environment. This is a critical component of the port, as it
    ensures that the Python implementation can interact with the original Java implementation.
