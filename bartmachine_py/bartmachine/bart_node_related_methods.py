"""
Node-related methods for bartMachine.

This module provides methods for working with tree nodes in the BART model.

R File Correspondence:
    This Python module corresponds to 'src/r/bartmachine_cpp_port/bart_node_related_methods.R' 
    in the original R package.

Role in Port:
    This module handles the creation, manipulation, and traversal of tree nodes
    in the BART model. It provides the core tree data structures and operations
    that are essential for the BART algorithm.
