"""
Cross-validation utilities for bartMachine.

This module provides functions for cross-validation of BART models.

R File Correspondence:
    This Python module corresponds to 'src/r/bartmachine_cpp_port/bart_package_cross_validation.R' 
    in the original R package.

Role in Port:
    This module handles cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning and model selection.
    It provides functions for k-fold cross-validation and grid search over hyperparameters.

# PLACEHOLDER MODULE: This module will be fully implemented during the porting process
