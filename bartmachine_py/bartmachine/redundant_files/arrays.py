Array utilities for bartMachine.

This module provides array-related utilities for the bartMachine package.

R File Correspondence:
    This Python module corresponds to 'src/r/bartmachine_cpp_port/bart_arrays.R' 
    in the original R package.

Role in Port:
    This module handles array creation, manipulation, and utility functions
    needed for BART model implementation. It provides the array data structures
    that are used throughout the package.

# PLACEHOLDER MODULE: This module will be fully implemented during the porting process
