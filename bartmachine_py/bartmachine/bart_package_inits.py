"""
Initialization utilities for bartMachine.

This module provides functions for initializing the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
and other resources needed for BART models.

R File Correspondence:
    This Python module corresponds to 'src/r/bartmachine_cpp_port/bart_package_inits.R' 
    in the original R package.

Role in Port:
    This module handles the initialization of the Java environment and other resources
    needed for BART models. It provides functions for starting and stopping the JVM,
    loading Java classes, and setting up the environment for BART models.

# PLACEHOLDER MODULE: This module will be fully implemented during the porting process
