Continue implementing the bartMachine port project with our revised task sequence. We're now working on the task-8-1-python-structure branch and need to implement Task 8.1: Python Project Structure Setup as outlined in the revised task sequence.

## Task 8.1: Python Project Structure Setup

**Objective**: Set up the Python project structure with Java interoperability to begin the R to Python port phase.

**Key Components**:
1. Create a well-structured Python package for the bartMachine port
2. Set up Java interoperability to call the original Java implementation
3. Establish a build system and development environment
4. Create initial package files and documentation

**Implementation Approach**:
1. Project Structure Setup:
   - Create the Python package directory structure
   - Set up module files and package organization

2. Java Interoperability Setup:
   - Research and select the appropriate Java-Python bridge
   - Implement the Java bridge module
   - Set up Java environment detection and configuration

3. Build System Setup:
   - Create setup.py with package metadata and dependencies
   - Set up requirements.txt with development dependencies

4. Initial Package Files:
   - Create __init__.py with package imports and version
   - Create placeholder modules with docstrings
   - Create basic documentation

5. Testing Framework:
   - Set up pytest configuration
   - Create basic test files
   - Implement test utilities

**Validation**:
- The Python package structure follows best practices
- The Java bridge can successfully load and call methods from the bartMachine JAR
- The build system correctly installs all dependencies
- Basic tests pass

This task is the first step in Phase 2 of our revised approach, where we port the R components to Python while maintaining the Java backend. This approach allows us to validate the Python port independently before migrating to the C++ backend.
