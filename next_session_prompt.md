Continue implementing the bartMachine port from Java to C++. We're working on the task-7-1-r-cpp-bridge branch and need to implement Task 7.1 as outlined in the task sequence.

## Task 7.1: R-to-C++ Bridge Implementation

**Objective**: Create R bindings for C++ implementation to enable calling our C++ code from R.

**Key Components**:
1. Implement Rcpp interface files to bridge between R and our C++ implementation
2. Modify the R bartMachine package to use our C++ backend instead of the Java backend
3. Ensure the R interface can properly call all the necessary C++ functions

**Implementation Approach**:
1. First, analyze the existing R-to-Java bridge to understand how the R package currently interfaces with Java
2. Create equivalent Rcpp interface files that will connect R to our C++ implementation
3. Modify the R package to use our C++ backend instead of the Java backend
4. Test the R-to-C++ bridge with simple function calls to verify connectivity
5. Implement more complex interactions to ensure full functionality

**Validation**:
- Verify that R can successfully call C++ functions
- Ensure data can be passed correctly between R and C++
- Confirm that the R interface works with our C++ implementation as it did with the Java implementation

Remember that this is an exact port, so the R-to-C++ bridge should provide the same functionality as the existing R-to-Java bridge, allowing for a seamless transition from the Java backend to our C++ backend.
