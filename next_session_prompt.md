Continue implementing the bartMachine port from Java to C++. We're working on the task-7-1-random-number-generation-review branch and need to implement Task 7.1 as outlined in the task sequence.

## Task 7.1: Random Number Generation Review

**Objective**: Review the random number generation implementation to identify discrepancies between the Java and C++ implementations.

**Key Components**:
1. Compare `ExactPortMersenneTwister.java` with `exact_port_mersenne_twister.cpp`
2. Review usage of random number generator in all files
3. Document all discrepancies in random number generation

**Implementation Approach**:
1. Compare `ExactPortMersenneTwister.java` with `exact_port_mersenne_twister.cpp`:
   - Perform line-by-line comparison of all methods
   - Verify constructor implementations
   - Check seed initialization
   - Verify all random number generation methods

2. Review usage of random number generator in all files:
   - Identify all calls to random number generation methods
   - Verify consistent usage patterns between Java and C++

3. Document all discrepancies in random number generation:
   - Create detailed reports of findings using the discrepancy template
   - Prioritize issues based on impact
   - Update the issue tracker with all identified discrepancies

**Validation**:
- Comprehensive report of RNG discrepancies
- All discrepancies documented using the established template
- Issue tracker updated with all identified issues
- Ready to begin implementing fixes for the identified discrepancies

This task is critical for ensuring that the random number generation in the C++ port is functionally equivalent to the Java implementation, which is a prerequisite for all subsequent components that rely on random number generation.
