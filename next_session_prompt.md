Continue implementing the bartMachine port from Java to C++. We're working on the task-6-2-regression-classification branch and need to implement Task 6.2 as outlined in the task sequence.

Please refer to:
1. CONSTRAINTS.md for the exact porting requirements
2. PORTING_CHECKLIST.md for step-by-step guidance on exact porting
3. PORTING_GUIDELINES.md for detailed implementation workflow
4. TASK_SEQUENCE.md for this task's context in the overall project
5. task_6_2_prompt.md for the specific task requirements
6. task_6_2_plan.md for the implementation strategy
7. tests/test_task_6_2.cpp for the test cases to validate the implementation
8. The original Java source at /Users/mark/Documents/Cline/bartMachine/src/bartMachine/ for reference

Focus on implementing the specialized bartMachine implementations:
- bartMachineRegression
- bartMachineClassification
- Multi-threaded variants (if applicable)

## Implementation Approach
1. For each method, first show the original Java code in a code block
2. Then implement the C++ version with line-by-line comments referencing the Java code
3. Explicitly go through the PORTING_CHECKLIST.md before, during, and after implementation
4. Focus on exact translation rather than improvements or optimizations

Remember that this is an exact port, so the C++ implementation should match the Java implementation's behavior precisely.
