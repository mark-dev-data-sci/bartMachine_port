Continue implementing the bartMachine port from Java to C++. We're working on the task-7-2-performance-optimization branch and need to implement Task 7.2 as outlined in the task sequence.

Please refer to:
1. CONSTRAINTS.md for the exact porting requirements
2. PORTING_CHECKLIST.md for step-by-step guidance on exact porting
3. PORTING_GUIDELINES.md for detailed implementation workflow

## Task 7.2: Validation with Original Datasets

**Objective**: Compare C++ implementation with Java using original R interface to ensure numerical equivalence.

**Key Components**:
1. Run identical workflows with both implementations (Java and C++)
2. Compare results for numerical equivalence
3. Document any discrepancies
4. Optimize performance where possible without changing results

**Implementation Approach**:
1. Create validation datasets that can be used with both Java and C++ implementations
2. Implement test scripts that run the same workflows on both implementations
3. Compare the results for numerical equivalence
4. Identify and document any discrepancies
5. Optimize the C++ implementation for performance where possible without changing results

**Validation**:
- Identical results between Java and C++ backends on standard datasets
- Performance benchmarks showing C++ implementation is at least as fast as Java
- Documentation of any discrepancies and their causes

This task is critical for ensuring that our C++ port produces the same results as the original Java implementation, while potentially offering performance improvements.
