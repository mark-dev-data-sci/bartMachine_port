Continue implementing the bartMachine port from Java to C++. We're working on the task-7-0-code-review-setup branch and need to implement Task 7.0 as outlined in the task sequence.

Please refer to:

## Task 7.0: Setup for Code Review

**Objective**: Establish framework for systematic code review of the C++ port against the original Java implementation.

**Key Components**:
1. Create structured template for documenting code discrepancies
2. Set up tracking system for identified issues
3. Establish consistent methodology for comparing Java and C++ code

**Implementation Approach**:
1. Create a template document for recording code discrepancies that includes:
   - File and line number information
   - Original Java code
   - Current C++ implementation
   - Description of the discrepancy
   - Potential impact on functionality
   - Suggested fix
   - Priority level

2. Set up a tracking system for identified issues:
   - Create a central document to track all identified issues
   - Include status tracking (identified, analyzed, fixed, verified)
   - Add priority levels for each issue
   - Include dependencies between issues

3. Establish a consistent methodology for comparing Java and C++ code:
   - Define a systematic approach for line-by-line comparison
   - Create guidelines for identifying equivalent functionality
   - Establish criteria for determining when a discrepancy is significant
   - Define a process for verifying fixes

**Validation**:
- Complete template document for recording discrepancies
- Functional tracking system for issues
- Documented methodology for code comparison
- Ready to begin detailed code review of specific components

This task is critical for ensuring that the subsequent code review tasks are conducted systematically and thoroughly, leading to a C++ implementation that is functionally equivalent to the original Java implementation.
