  - Benchmark against original implementation

- Task 11.3: Package and release
  - Finalize package structure

  - Prepare for release

## Rationale for Revision

The revised task sequence introduces a more gradual migration approach:

1. First, we port the R components to Python while maintaining the Java backend (Phase 2).
2. Once the Python port is validated with the Java backend, we migrate to the C++ backend (Phase 3).
3. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive code review and validation (Phase 4).

This approach offers several advantages:
- It allows us to validate the Python port independently of the C++ port.
- It provides a clear reference point for validating the C++ implementation.
- It reduces the risk of introducing bugs in both the Python and C++ components simultaneously.
- It addresses the dependency issues identified during Task 7.1, particularly for random number generation.

## Next Steps

1. Complete the current Task 7.1 by documenting the identified discrepancies (DISC-002) without attempting to fix them.
2. Begin Phase 2 with Task 8.1 to set up the Python project structure with Java interoperability.
3. Proceed through the R to Python port tasks in sequence, maintaining the Java backend.
4. Once the Python port is validated, begin the migration to the C++ backend in Phase 3.
5. Conduct the comprehensive code review in Phase 4 once the migration is complete.
